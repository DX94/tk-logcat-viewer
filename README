LogCat is a replacement LogCat viewer for android that provides more control
over the display and filtering of Android logcat output than is available with
the eclipse plugin.

I wanted several features that the Eclipse built-in viewer doesn't provide:
- The ability to filter and search based on regular expressions
- The ability to view a selected set of app tags in one pane.
- The ability to change the filtering and searching on the fly.

To try it out, connect a single Android device to your computer, and run:
  wish logcat.tcl
This is an early prototype, let me know if you think it could be useful 
(or what you think I should add to make it so).

Notes
- Make sure adb is on your path
- I run this on Linux, but it should also work on Windows and OSX
- The code exists to allow user's to change any of the filter colors, but
  I haven't decided on a UI yet
